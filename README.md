![Sample Result](resources/banner.png)

## Overview

NIR-GAN is a project dedicated to predicting the Near-Infrared (NIR) band from RGB Sentinel-2 satellite imagery using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The goal is to train a model that can generate an accurate synthetic NIR band, providing useful NIR information where only RGB data is available.

## Project Objectives

- **NIR Prediction**: Use a GAN architecture to synthesize the NIR band directly from the RGB bands of Sentinel-2 imagery.
  
- **Visualization of NIR Quality**: Track the GANâ€™s progress and evaluate the quality of the predicted NIR bands without relying on indices like NDVI that require both true NIR and red bands.

## Data
The model is trained using low-resolution (10m) Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, specifically focusing on RGB inputs and the corresponding NIR band. This dataset provides the necessary spectral information in the visible and near-infrared range to train the GAN for NIR prediction.
- **Input Data**: Sentinel-2 RGB Bands, used as input to the generator to synthesize the NIR band.
- **Target Data**: Sentinel-2 NIR Band, serves as the ground truth for training the model, allowing it to learn the mapping from RGB to NIR.


### Output Data
- **Fake NIR Images**: Generated NIR bands based solely on the input RGB bands.

## Architecture
The GAN model used in this project is a modified version of SRResNet, tailored specifically for predicting a single NIR band from three input RGB bands. The generator has its upscaling components disabled, focusing solely on NIR prediction rather than super-resolution. The discriminator is adapted to accept and evaluate only the NIR band, assessing the quality of the synthetic output. This model, selected for rapid experimentation, comprises approximately 25 million parameters, balancing model complexity with efficient training.

- **Generator**: The generator is based on a modified SRResNet architecture, adapted to produce a single NIR band output from RGB input. 3 bands in, 1 band out.
- **Discriminator**: The discriminator classifies the synthetic NIR bands as real or fake. This model is structured as a deep convolutional network with progressively deeper feature extraction. 1 band in, evaluation score out.
